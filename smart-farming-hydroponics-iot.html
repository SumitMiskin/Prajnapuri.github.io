        <h2>Smart Farming Zone with Hydroponics + IoT</h2>
        <p class="lead">An urban farming initiative combining hydroponic systems and IoT sensors for efficient, space‑saving food production and real-time monitoring.</p>

        <h3>Problem in the City</h3>
        <p>Modern cities face serious challenges in food production due to rapid urbanization. The availability of land for traditional farming is extremely limited, while the population continues to grow. Most vegetables are transported from distant rural areas, increasing costs, reducing freshness, and adding to carbon emissions. Traditional farming methods also consume excessive amounts of water and are highly dependent on weather conditions. Additionally, the lack of real-time monitoring makes it difficult to detect plant stress or system failures early, leading to lower productivity and food security concerns.</p>

        <h4>Key Problems</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Limited agricultural land in cities</li>
          <li>High cost of fresh vegetables</li>
          <li>Heavy water wastage</li>
          <li>Climate dependency and unpredictability</li>
          <li>Lack of data-driven monitoring</li>
          <li>Urban food security risks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
        <p>The Smart Farming Zone integrates hydroponic farming with IoT technology to enable efficient, sustainable urban agriculture. In this system, plants grow without soil using nutrient-rich water circulated through hydroponic channels or vertical structures. IoT sensors continuously monitor environmental and nutrient conditions, while automated systems make real-time adjustments to ensure optimal plant growth. This solution allows farming in rooftops, warehouses, and unused urban spaces and supports year-round crop production.</p>

        <h4>Solution Highlights</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Soil-less hydroponic cultivation</li>
          <li>Vertical and space-efficient farming</li>
          <li>IoT-based real-time monitoring</li>
          <li>Automated control of nutrients, water, and light</li>
          <li>Year-round, climate-independent farming</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>System Components</h3>
        <p>The system consists of sensors that collect real-time data, actuators that respond automatically, and cloud-based platforms that analyze and visualize information.</p>

        <h4>Main Components</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> temperature, humidity, pH, EC, light intensity, water level</li>
          <li><strong>Actuators:</strong> pumps, nutrient injectors, LED grow lights, ventilation fans</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud platform</strong> for data storage and analytics</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile/web dashboard</strong> for monitoring and control</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Will Use It</h3>
        <p>The Smart Farming Zone is designed for a wide range of users, from individuals to large organizations. Urban farmers and startups can use it for commercial food production, while residential societies can grow fresh vegetables locally. Restaurants and hotels benefit from consistent, high-quality produce, and municipal authorities can use it to promote sustainability and smart city initiatives.</p>

        <h4>Target Users</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Urban farmers and agri-startups</li>
          <li>Residential societies and housing complexes</li>
          <li>Restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets</li>
          <li>Municipal corporations</li>
          <li>Educational and research institutions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business Model</h3>
        <p>The business model is flexible and scalable, enabling multiple revenue streams. Fresh produce can be sold directly to consumers or supplied in bulk to businesses. Subscription models ensure steady income, while smart farming services and training programs add additional revenue.</p>

        <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Direct sale of vegetables and herbs</li>
          <li>Subscription-based produce delivery</li>
          <li>B2B supply to hotels and restaurants</li>
          <li>Smart farming installation and maintenance</li>
          <li>Data analytics and consulting services</li>
          <li>Training and workshops</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Algorithms Used</h3>
        <p>Advanced algorithms make the system intelligent and efficient. Machine learning models predict crop yield and harvest time, while optimization algorithms ensure efficient use of water, nutrients, and energy. Control algorithms maintain stable environmental conditions, and anomaly detection algorithms help identify problems early.</p>

        <h4>Algorithms Applied</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Linear Regression / Random Forest – yield and harvest prediction</li>
