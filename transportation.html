          <ul class="text-dark">
            <li><p class="mb-2">Building a Smart Transportation system is essential for a developing city, as it ensures smooth traffic flow, reduces congestion and pollution, and enhances commuter safety. Efficient mobility also supports economic activity, improves emergency response times, and contributes to better urban planning.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">To implement a Smart Transportation system, multiple algorithms and data structures can be used to manage and optimize road networks, traffic signals, routing, and commuter analytics. We model the city's road network as a graph, with intersections and key points as nodes, and roads between them as edges weighted by distance or congestion.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest travel time between key locations like hospitals, schools, or police stations. This helps in navigation apps and emergency vehicle dispatch systems. For a larger-scale pre-computation of travel times between all pairs of locations, Floyd–Warshall's algorithm can be applied.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">When planning the main transportation backbone (e.g., placement of highways or rapid transit routes), we can use Prim's algorithm to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that connects important regions with minimum total construction cost. Prim's is particularly effective for dense city networks, as it grows the MST from a starting node and works well with many interconnected roads.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">Kruskal's algorithm can be used for the initial planning of large, less-connected zones (e.g., rural outskirts), where the network is sparse and edge weights differ significantly. It sorts all possible connections and adds the shortest valid ones without creating cycles.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">Heap data structures (priority queues) are used internally in Dijkstra's algorithm and also independently to prioritize traffic events, such as traffic light updates, road maintenance scheduling, or routing emergency vehicles. We can apply Heap Sort for ranking routes or sorting locations based on congestion severity.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">For managing real-time sensor data (vehicle count, speed, signal status), we can use a Lookup Table for constant-time access to location-wise traffic data. A Fenwick Tree (BIT) can be employed to maintain and query cumulative vehicle counts over time across different checkpoints.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">To analyze the road network's structure and detect possible alternate paths or cycles, we use DFS (Depth First Search) and BFS (Breadth First Search). These help in identifying redundant paths or connected zones, and in congestion pattern analysis.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">Hash tables are used to map vehicle IDs, routes, or sensor codes to their corresponding metadata quickly. For indexing road names or routes, a Trie enables fast prefix-based searches, improving GPS and map-search functionalities.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p class="mb-2">We can also apply sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort to organize areas based on traffic density, allowing dynamic planning of signal timing or rerouting strategies. For smaller lists like nearby intersections or event queues, Insertion Sort or Selection Sort may suffice.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-dark mt-3">
            <li><p>In cases of traffic violation logs or vehicle identification through ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition), string search algorithms like Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP), Boyer–Moore, or Rabin–Karp can help detect specific license patterns or flagged vehicle IDs efficiently.</p></li>
          </ul>
