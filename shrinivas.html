Night-Time Safe Travel Services are programs, transportation options, and safety tools that help people move around a city safely after dark.
Cities, universities, and transportation companies create these services so you can travel at night with less risk and more support. 
•	Safe-Walk Escorts
Trained staff or volunteers walk with you at night to your home, car, or bus stop.
•	 Night Shuttles / Late-Night Buses
Special buses or vans that operate after dark to provide safe transportation.
•	Ride-Share Safety Features
Tools in apps like Uber/Lyft (trip sharing, PIN check, emergency help) to make rides safer at night.
•	Safe Havens / Safe Spots
Well-lit businesses or designated locations where you can go if you feel unsafe and need help.

A Drone-Based Fast Delivery Network:
Is a system where small flying drones are used to deliver packages quickly from one location to another.
Instead of using trucks, bikes, or cars, deliveries travel through the air, making them much faster and less affected by traffic.
1.Provide safe and reliable transport after dark
Services such as night buses, ride-share safety tools, safe-walk escorts, and dedicated nighttime taxi stands ensure that people can travel safely when regular transport is limited.
2.Improve accessibility for vulnerable groups
Women, students, elderly people, night-shift workers, and persons with disabilities benefit from well-lit routes, secure waiting areas, and verified drivers — reducing fear and risk during night travel.
3. Reduce dependence on private vehicles
By offering reliable night transport alternatives, these services help people avoid buying private cars, which supports sustainable urban mobility.


HealthTech: Smart Emergency Response Systems 
Smart Emergency Response Systems support SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 11.2, which emphasize ensuring safe, accessible, and efficient emergency services for all, including vulnerable and underserved groups.
Smart emergency technologies use digital tools—such as IoT devices, AI, GPS, and real-time communication platforms—to improve response time, enhance coordination, and ensure better outcomes during medical emergencies, accidents, or disasters.

1. Faster and more efficient emergency response 
AI-powered dispatch systems, real-time GPS tracking, and automated alerts allow ambulances and emergency teams to reach patients more quickly, reducing mortality and improving health outcomes.
2. Improved accessibility for vulnerable groups
Elderly people, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, and those living in remote areas benefit from technologies like wearable medical devices, panic buttons, telemedicine triage, and home IoT sensors that automatically call for help.
3. Better coordination between health services
Integrated platforms connect ambulances, hospitals, emergency rooms, police, and fire departments—ensuring that patients are taken to the right facility with the right resources at the right time.
4. Data-driven emergency planning and prevention
Smart sensors and analytics help cities identify accident hotspots, predict emergency needs, and prepare more effectively for disasters, supporting safer and more resilient communities.
A Smart Farming Zone with Hydroponics :
Is a modern farming system where plants are grown without soil, and all farming conditions are monitored and controlled using smart sensors and technology.
 How It Works
•	Hydroponics allows plants to grow in nutrient-rich water instead of soil.
•	IoT sensors check important conditions like water level, pH, temperature, humidity, and light.
•	The sensors send data to a mobile app or control system.
•	The system can automatically adjust water, nutrients, and lighting to help plants grow better.
